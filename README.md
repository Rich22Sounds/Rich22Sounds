Hi, my name is
Richard MÃ¼ck

Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be in IT. Creating websites or editing videos, recordings or photos is something for me. 
Apart from design, I like to think about programming and different processes over work.

Programs i work with:

FL studio, Audacity, DaVinci Resolve, Photoshop, GIMP, Inkscape

C++, Java

Javascript, HTML, CSS
